## What version of March Hare does this guide cover??

This guide covers March Hare 2.12.



## Two ways to specify connection parameters

With Bunny, connection parameters (host, port, username, vhost and so on) can be passed in two forms:

 * As a map of attributes
 * As a connection URI string (Ã  la JDBC)


### Using a Map of Parameters

Map options that Bunny will recognize are

 * `:host`
 * `:port`
 * `:user` or `:username`
 * `:pass` or `:password`
 * `:vhost` or `virtual_host`
 * `:heartbeat` or `:heartbeat_interval`, in seconds, default is 0 (no heartbeats). `:server` means "use the value from RabbitMQ config"

To connect to RabbitMQ with a map of parameters, pass them to `MarchHare.connect`. The connection
will be established immediately:

``` ruby
conn = MarchHare.connect(:host => "localhost", :vhost => "myapp.production", :user => "bunny", :password => "t0ps3kret")
```

`MarchHare.connect` returns a connection instance that is used to open channels. More about channels later in this guide.

#### Default parameters

Default connection parameters are

``` ruby
{
  :hostname  => "127.0.0.1",
  :port      => 5672,
  :ssl       => false,
  :vhost     => "/",
  :username  => "guest",
  :password  => "guest",
  :heartbeat => 0, # will use RabbitMQ setting
}
```


### Using Connection URIs (Strings)

It is also possible to specify connection parameters as a URI string:

``` ruby
MarchHare.connect(:uri => "amqp://guest:guest@vm188.dev.megacorp.com/profitd.qa")
```

Unfortunately, there is no URI standard for AMQP URIs, so while several schemes used in the wild share the same basic idea, they differ in some details.
The implementation used by Bunny aims to encourage URIs that work as widely as possible.

Here are some examples of valid AMQP URIs:

 * amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com
 * amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com:5672
 * amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com:5672
 * amqp://hedgehog:t0ps3kr3t@hub.megacorp.internal/production
 * amqps://hub.megacorp.internal/%2Fvault

The URI scheme should be "amqp", or "amqps" if SSL is required.

The host, port, username and password are represented in the authority component of the URI in the same way as in HTTP URIs.

The vhost is obtained from the first segment of the path, with the leading slash removed.  The path should contain only a single segment (i.e, the only slash in it should be the leading one). If the vhost is to include slashes or other reserved URI characters, these should be percent-escaped.

### Connection Failures

If a connection does not succeed, Bunny will raise one of the following exceptions:

 * `MarchHare::PossibleAuthenticationFailureException` indicates an authentication issue or that connection to RabbitMQ was closed before successfully finishing connection negotiation
 * `java.net.UnknownHostException` indicates that the host is misconfigured or does not resolve (e.g. due to a DNS issue)
 * `java.net.ConnectException` indicates that RabbitMQ is not running on the target host or it binds to a different port


### Heartbeats and Connection Failure Detection

Due to how TCP works, it sometimes can take a while (minutes) to detect an unresponsive
peer. To make connection failure detection quicker, the protocol has a feature called
"heartbeats". Client and server exchange heartbeat frames periodically (about 1/2
the configured timeout value). When either peer detects 2 missed heartbeats, it
should consider the connection to be dead.

`:heartbeat` is the option passed to `MarchHare.connect` to configure the desired
timeout interval. We recommend setting this value in the 10-30 seconds range.

Enabling heartbeats will also ensure firewalls won't consider connections with low
activity to be stale.



## PaaS Environments

### The RABBITMQ_URL Environment Variable

Several PaaS environments set `RABBITMQ_URL` environment variable to indicate the connection URI
to use. In this case, connect using the connection URI. Accessing environment variables
with March Hare is not any different from any other Ruby code:

``` ruby
MarchHare.connect(:uri => ENV["RABBITMQ_URL"])
```


## Opening a Channel

Some applications need multiple connections to RabbitMQ. However, it is undesirable to keep many TCP connections open at the same time because
doing so consumes system resources and makes it more difficult to configure firewalls. AMQP 0-9-1 connections are multiplexed with channels that can
be thought of as "lightweight connections that share a single TCP connection".

To open a channel, use the `MarchHare::Session#create_channel` method:

``` ruby
conn = MarchHare.connect
ch   = conn.create_channel
```

Channels are typically long lived: you open one or more of them and use them for a period of time, as opposed to opening
a new channel for each published message, for example.


## Closing Channels

To close a channel, use the `MarchHare::Channel#close` method. A closed channel
can no longer be used.

``` ruby
conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
ch.close
```


## Connecting in Web applications (Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, etc)

When connecting in Web apps, the rule of thumb is: do it in an initializer, not controller
actions or request handlers.

### Ruby on Rails

Currently Bunny does not have integration points for Rails (e.g. a rail tie).


## Disconnecting

To close a connection, use the `MarchHare::Session#close` function. This will automatically
close all channels of that connection first:

``` ruby
conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

conn.close
```


## Troubleshooting

If you have read this guide and still have issues with connecting, check our [Troubleshooting guide](/articles/troubleshooting.html)
and feel free to ask [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-amqp).


## Wrapping Up

There are two ways to specify connection parameters with Bunny: with a map of parameters or via URI string.
Connection issues are indicated by various exceptions. If the `RABBITMQ_URL` env variable is set, Bunny
will use its value as RabbitMQ connection URI.
